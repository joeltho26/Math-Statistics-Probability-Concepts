    "#### LSTM Autoencoders:\n",
    "- the lstm autoencoder is used for sequential or timeseries data and they are based on RNNs architecture\n",
    "- The autoencoder will have an encoder and a decoder in its architecture\n",
    "    - Encoder: \n",
    "        - transforms the original data into lower dimension with latent space representation\n",
    "        - converts the input data into fixed size vectors by preserving and capturing the temporal features\n",
    "    - Decoder: \n",
    "        - transform the latent space represented data into the original input data\n",
    "        - takes the encoded vector and reconstructs the original input data\n",
    "- Training Phase:\n",
    "    - the autoencoder model is training on normal data and not abnormal data\n",
    "    - the goal of the model during training is to reduce the reconstruction error i.e. MSE between the reconstructed output data to the original input data\n",
    "- Detection Phase:\n",
    "    - feed new unseen data which consist of normal and abnormal data \n",
    "    - now, calculate the reconstruction error for each sequence. \n",
    "    - the reconstruction error serves as the anomaly score\n",
    "    - set a threshold for reconstruction score\n",
    "        - generally its mean + 3 std\n",
    "    - any sequence that exceeds the threshold value is flagged as anomaly"
