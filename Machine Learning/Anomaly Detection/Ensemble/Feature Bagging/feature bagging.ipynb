    "- used to identify anomaly detection\n",
    "- here we can use LOF, Isolation Forest, KNN, Hierarichal, K-means techniques\n",
    "- just like having collection of trees in ensemble here we have collection of the above isolation techniques\n",
    "- it performs the same as bagging algorithm, perform bootstrapping and aggregation \n",
    "- small difference in bootstrapping, here along with row sampling with replacement, here we also perform feature sampling without replacement\n",
    "- now the each models will predict and anomaly score and we take the average of it\n",
    "- we set a threshold by the use of statistical methods like IQR, Percentiles, SD based\n",
    "- data point beyond the threshold score helps us to identify the outliers"
