    "#### Independent Component Analysis:\n",
    "Centering and Whitening:\n",
    "- Centering: the data is zero centered by subtracting the actual value with the mean value for each data point\n",
    "- Whitening: it decorrelates the data and the variance of each component is scaled to 1. PCA is used for whitening\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Independent Components:\n",
    "- ICA now finds for a rotation unmixing matrix that transforms whitened data into independent components that like maximizes the kurtosis (non gaussian properties) or minimizing the mutal information between components\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "- the number of independent components i.e. dimensions, extracted by the iterative optimization algorithm such as FastICA is often less than the original number of dimensions\n",
    "- \"n_componenets\" value can be set to reduce the dimensions in the algorithm library"
