    "- here in transposed convolutions, it uses upsampling i.e. it increases the dimension of the matrix\n",
    "- it is not truly reversing the convolution operations\n",
    "- in transposed convolution, we use the kernels in transposed form and then multiply with the encoded vector to produce the input data matrix. \n",
