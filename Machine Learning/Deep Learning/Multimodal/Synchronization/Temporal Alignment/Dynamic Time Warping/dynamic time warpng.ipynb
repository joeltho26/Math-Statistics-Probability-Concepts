    "- it is commonly used on time series data\n",
    "- calculate the distance matrix \n",
    "    - used to check the similarities between two sequences at certain points i.e. euclidean distance is calculated\n",
    "- calculate the cost matrix and the accumulated cost \n",
    "    - it accumulates the minimum distances from the start of the sequence to the current point in the sequence \n",
    "    - it helps in optimal path finding by the accumulated cost \n",
