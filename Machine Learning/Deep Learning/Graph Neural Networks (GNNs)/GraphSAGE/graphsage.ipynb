    "- the graphSAGE introduces the inductive learning \n",
    "- inductive learning means the graph has a generalization function which can generate embedding for future nodes or for entirely new graph without retraining the existing graph model\n",
    "- steps of GraphSAGE:\n",
    "    - initialization\n",
    "        - each node is given an initial feature representation vector\n",
    "    - neighborhood sampling\n",
    "        - here it doesnt consider the whole list of neighbors instead a selective sample of neighbors \n",
    "    - feature aggregation\n",
    "        - now to aggregate the sampled neighbors transformed feature representation via below learnable aggregation functions\n",
    "            - Mean Aggregator\n",
    "            - Pooling Aggregator\n",
    "            - LSTM Aggregator\n",
    "    - concatenation and update\n",
    "        - the new feature representation of node is produced by the aggregated neighbour information and the node's previous layer embedding information\n",
    "    - normalization\n",
    "        - the resulting embedding is normalized ot overcome vanishing or exploding gradients problem\n",
