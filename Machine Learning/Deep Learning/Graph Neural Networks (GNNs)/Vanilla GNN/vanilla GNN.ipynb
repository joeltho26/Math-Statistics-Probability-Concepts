    "    - initialization\n",
    "        - each node has a input feature vector\n",
    "    - message passing\n",
    "        - for K iterations, we update feature representation for each node by passing messages\n",
    "        - 3 components\n",
    "            - message generation\n",
    "                - each neighbor \"u\" of a node \"v\" generate a message\n",
    "                - the generated message is a transformation of neighbor feature vector \"u\"\n",
    "            - aggregation\n",
    "                - all the messages from the neighbour is gathered and aggregated into a single vector\n",
    "                - the aggregate function is permutation invariant i.e. the order of the messages received doesnt change the aggregated result\n",
    "            - updation\n",
    "                - combines its own feature representation vector with the aggregated result \n",
    "                - this combination is usually done by MLP, GRU or LSTM\n",
    "    - prediction\n",
    "        - now all nodes have their final learned embeddings\n",
    "        - node level tasks\n",
    "            - eg: users interest\n",
