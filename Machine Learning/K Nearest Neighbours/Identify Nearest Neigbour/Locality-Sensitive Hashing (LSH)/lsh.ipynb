    "\n",
    "- ```multiple hash functions``` are designed to perform locality sensitive hashing\n",
    "```Hash Function```:\n",
    "- each hash function is developed to ```hash each record``` in the dataset and ensure has ```minimal collision```\n",
    "    - ```Collision```:\n",
    "        - ```two different string``` will produce ```same hash output``` value which leads to error output\n",
    "- the ```hashed value``` of each record is stored in their corresponding bucket of a ```Hash Table/Map```\n",
    "- ```Hash function criteria```:\n",
    "    - data points that have small distances are similar and data points that have large distances are dissimilar \n",
    "- implements ```amplification``` to reduce false positives and negatives\n",
    "    - concatenating multiple hash functions values into one\n",
    "    - breaking the concatenated hash function value into several bands (i.e. separate hash function values)\n",
    "- consider a pair of data points to be ```similar```, when there is atleast ```1 collision``` w.r.t individual hash function\n",
    "\n",
    "```Prediction```:\n",
    "- collision data points are considered as the ```candidates``` for nearest neighbor\n",
    "- then distance is computed between query point and each candidate nearest neighbour data point to find the actual nearest neighbour\n",
    "        - hamming distance (bit wise)\n",
    "        - cosine similarity\n",
    "        - jaccard similarity"
