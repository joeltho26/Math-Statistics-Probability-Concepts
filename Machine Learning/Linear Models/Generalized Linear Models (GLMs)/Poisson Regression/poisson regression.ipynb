    "- used when we have poisson distribution of data\n",
    "- it is a generalized linear model\n",
    "- its working is very similar to gamma regression\n",
    "- the gamma regression also has coefficient similar to linear regression.\n",
    "- a link function is used to connect the linear predictors and the mean of response variable\n",
    "    - link functions:\n",
    "        - log link (standard choice)\n",
    "- like OLS for linear regression, the coefficients of gamma regression is estimated by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n",

    "        - we use a likelihood function, by varying the values for the coefficients of gamma regression, we will find the maximum value for the likelihood function\n",

    "        - the value of likelihood function is made maximum via Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)\n",
