    "#### Spline Transformation:\n",
    "- spline are piecewise polynomial functions\n",
    "- it means instead of fitting a single polynomial function for whole dataset, the dataset is broken into n intervals and separate polynomial functions are fit into it. n polynomials functions combined together in a point called knot which results in a smooth continuous curve\n",
    "- used to capture non linear pattern in the dataset thereby increasing model accuracy\n",
    "- works for both gaussian and non-gaussian data\n",
    "- works with both positive and negative values\n",
    "- achieve almost normality of data"
